Cut things:
- Half or quater potatoes, doesn't matter as long as they're about the same size
- Cut up chicken breasts into about the same sized pieces, I did about twice as big as the potato chunks
- Maybe smash up some garlic

Marinate things
- Get a big ziplock freezer back
- Throw in chicken and potatoes
- Throw in a squeezed lime, about the same amount of oil, spices
- Squeeze the air out
- Mix that all together like whoa
- For a while.
- Really mix it.
- If you don't your fiancee will get sad about how spicy her last potato wedge was.
- Let it chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes

Cook things:
- Preheat oven to 425F
- Lasagna pan worked for me
- Dump bag of awesome chicken+potatoes into lasagna pan
- Add a mug of water or broth because you want this chicken to be tender
- Insert into oven
- `/^(Siri|OK, Google|Cortana), please set a 25 minute alarm/`
- Hope your oven is level, maybe check back sooner and see if you need to add more water/broth

Is it done yet?:
- Poke badada with knife. Did it go in easy? Awesome, done.
- Poke chicken with blunt side of knife. Did it fall apart? Awesome, done.

Bonus Nachos:
- Take the chicken out of the pan
- Leave the potatoes in
- Throw oven on maximal carnage (broil, or highest setting)
- Little bit of salt on the potatoes
- Roast those puppies for a few more minutes to make them crispy
